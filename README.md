# Summary about me 

Cyber Security and related stuff are my passion. I am a lecturer (assistant Professor) at Information Security Group (ISG), Royal Holloway University of London. I have been teaching some modules related to cyber security such as computer and network security, access control, security protocols, data security,etc. I have been involved in different research projects tackling various topics in Blockchain and Distributed ledger technologies, wireless networks, security, IoT, privacy, risk and threats modelling.
